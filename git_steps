git branch -M main  
git push -u origin main  

======
Breakdown of the Command:
git remote add:

This command is used to add a new remote repository to your local Git repository.
A remote is a reference to a repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). It allows you to connect your local project with a remote repository so you can push (upload) or pull (download) changes.
origin:

This is the name you are giving to the remote repository. By convention, origin is typically used as the default name for the main remote.
You can use any name instead of origin, but using origin is standard practice.
https://github.com/manishaditya969/Webdevelopmentprojects.git:

This is the URL of the remote Git repository hosted on GitHub.
After adding this remote, your local Git repository will know where to push (upload) and pull (download) changes from.
Purpose of the Command:
By running this command, you are linking your local Git repository to the remote repository on GitHub. Once linked, you can use commands like:

git push origin main: Upload your changes to the remote repository.
git pull origin main: Download changes from the remote repository.
If you want to push your project to this GitHub repository after adding the remote, the typical sequence of commands would be:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main

whats -u

The -u flag in the git push command stands for upstream. It is used to set the default upstream branch for the current local branch.

Explanation of git push -u origin <branch>
When you run:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Here’s what happens:

git push: Pushes the changes in your local branch to the remote repository.
origin: Refers to the remote repository you added earlier (in your case, the GitHub repository).
main: Refers to the branch you're pushing (usually the main branch of your project).
-u (or --set-upstream): This option sets the remote branch (origin/main) as the upstream for your local main branch.
Why Use -u?
Once you set the upstream branch using -u, you don’t need to specify the remote and branch every time you push or pull in the future. After setting it, you can simply use:

bash
Copy code
git push
or

bash
Copy code
git pull
Git will automatically know which remote branch to push to or pull from because the upstream branch is already set.

Checking the Upstream Branch
You can check the upstream branch for your local branch using:

bash
Copy code
git branch -vv
This will show the local branches and their corresponding upstream branches.

Summary
-u sets the default remote branch (upstream branch) for your local branch.
Once set, future git push or git pull commands can be done without specifying the remote or branch.
