  IMPORTANT! Do not change any HTML
Don't add any classes/ids/elements 
Use what you know about combining selectors 
and CSS specificity instead.
Hint 1: The flag is 900px by 600px and the circle is 200px by 200px.
Hint 2: You can use CSS inspection to get the colors from

Positioning Breakdown for Each Element
Let's go through each element in your HTML and explain how positioning works for them based on your CSS.

1. .flag (Outer Container for the Flag)
css
Copy code
.flag {
  width: 900px;
  height: 600px;
  position: relative;
  background-color: #CE1126;
}
width: 900px and height: 600px: This sets the size of the flag container to be 900px wide and 600px tall.
position: relative: This establishes a positioning context for any absolutely positioned child elements inside .flag.
Background Color: The red color #CE1126 is applied to the entire .flag div, representing the background of the flag.
Effect of position: relative:
Since .flag is positioned relatively, any child elements with position: absolute inside it will be positioned relative to the top-left corner of .flag, not the entire page.

2. .flag > div (Blue Stripe)
css
Copy code
.flag > div {
  background-color: #002868;
  height: 300px;
  width: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 150px;
}
height: 300px and width: 100%: This sets the blue stripe to be 300px tall and as wide as the parent .flag (which is 900px).
position: absolute: Since .flag (its parent) has position: relative, this .flag > div is positioned relative to the top-left corner of .flag.
top: 150px: This moves the blue stripe 150px down from the top of the .flag container.
Background Color: The blue color #002868 is applied to this stripe.
Final Position:
The blue stripe covers the middle section of the flag, starting at 150px from the top and stretching across the full width.

3. .flag > div > div (White Circle)
css
Copy code
.flag > div > div {
  background-color: white;
  position: absolute;
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  top: 50px;
  left: 350px;
}
height: 200px and width: 200px: This sets the white circle to be a 200px by 200px square initially.
border-radius: 50%: This makes the square into a circle by applying a border radius of 50% on all sides.
position: absolute: Since its parent .flag > div (the blue stripe) has position: absolute, this circle is positioned relative to the top-left corner of the blue stripe.
top: 50px: This moves the circle 50px down from the top of the blue stripe.
left: 350px: This moves the circle 350px to the right from the left edge of the blue stripe.
Background Color: The white color is applied to the circle.
Final Position:
The white circle is centered horizontally within the blue stripe because:

The blue stripe is 900px wide.
The circle is 200px wide.
left: 350px ensures that the circle‚Äôs left edge starts 350px from the left edge of the stripe, leaving another 350px of space on the right (since 
350
+
200
+
350
=
900
350+200+350=900).
4. p (Text Elements)
Global <p> Styling:
css
Copy code
p {
  font-size: 5rem;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
font-size: 5rem: This sets the font size of all <p> elements to 5 times the root font size (typically 16px by default, so 
5
√ó
16
=
80
ùëù
ùë•
5√ó16=80px).
color: white: The text color is set to white by default.
text-align: center: This centers the text horizontally within its parent container.
padding: 0 and margin: 0: This removes any default padding or margin around the <p> elements.
.flag > p (The "The Flag" Text)
html
Copy code
<p>The Flag</p>
Since this <p> is a direct child of .flag, it inherits the global <p> styles.
Positioning: This <p> is positioned by the normal document flow (i.e., it‚Äôs not absolutely positioned), so it appears at the top of the .flag div, centered horizontally because of text-align: center.
.flag > div > div > p (The "of Laos" Text)
css
Copy code
.flag > div > div > p {
  color: black;
}
Text Color: The text color is overridden to black specifically for the <p> inside the white circle (.flag > div > div > p).
All other styles (font size, text alignment, padding, margin) are inherited from the global <p> styling.
Since the parent .flag > div > div (the white circle) is absolutely positioned within the blue stripe, the <p> is placed inside the white circle, centered horizontally due to text-align: center.
Summary of Positioning
.flag: Positioned relatively, serves as the parent container for all elements.
Blue stripe (.flag > div): Positioned absolutely within .flag, starts 150px down from the top and covers the middle third of the flag.
White circle (.flag > div > div): Positioned absolutely within the blue stripe, centered horizontally and placed 50px down from the top of the blue stripe.
"The Flag" text (.flag > p): Positioned normally (in flow) at the top of .flag, centered horizontally.
"of Laos" text (.flag > div > div > p): Positioned inside the white circle, inherits global <p> styles except for text color, which is overridden to black.
Final Output
This CSS creates a flag with:

A red background.
A blue horizontal stripe in the center.
A white circle centered horizontally inside the blue stripe.
The text "The Flag" at the top of the flag, and "of Laos" centered inside the white circle.
