When Should You Use position: relative on the Parent?
You should set the parent as position: relative when you want to create a positioning context for its absolutely positioned child elements.

Key Concept:
An absolutely positioned element (position: absolute) is always positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If no positioned ancestor is found, it will be positioned relative to the <html> or <body> (i.e., the entire page).

So, if you want an absolutely positioned child element to be placed within a specific parent, you need to make that parent a positioning context by giving it position: relative, absolute, or fixed.

Scenarios to Use position: relative
To Contain Absolutely Positioned Children:

Example: You have a tooltip, popup, or any element that needs to be positioned within a specific container.
Without position: relative on the parent, the child would position itself relative to the entire page, not the container.
html
Copy code
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">I am inside the parent</div>
</div>

<style>
  .parent {
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background-color: lightgray;
    position: relative; /* Create positioning context */
  }

  .child {
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
    background-color: coral;
  }
</style>
Explanation: Since the parent has position: relative, the .child element will be positioned 20px from the top and 20px from the left of .parent, not the entire page.
When You Don’t Want the Parent to Move, but Still Want to Control Children:
position: relative doesn’t change the position of the parent itself (it remains where it would naturally be in the document flow), but it allows you to create a positioning context for absolutely positioned children.
This is useful when you want to position child elements freely inside the parent without affecting the document flow.
For Layering (z-index):
Even if you don’t need to position a parent explicitly, using position: relative on a parent can be necessary if you want to apply z-index to its children.
Without a positioning context (relative, absolute, fixed), z-index may not behave as expected.
When You Don’t Need position: relative
If There Are No Absolutely Positioned Children:

If all child elements are positioned normally (i.e., position: static, which is the default), you don’t need to set position: relative on the parent.
If Children Are Positioned Relative to Another Ancestor:

Sometimes, you may want a child element to be positioned relative to an ancestor further up the DOM hierarchy. In that case, you don’t set position: relative on the immediate parent but on the desired ancestor.
Example: Without position: relative on Parent
html
Copy code
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">I am positioned relative to the body!</div>
</div>

<style>
  .parent {
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background-color: lightgray;
  }

  .child {
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
    background-color: coral;
  }
</style>
Explanation: Since .parent does not have position: relative, .child will position itself relative to the <body>, not the .parent.
Summary
Use position: relative on the parent when:

You have absolutely positioned children, and you want them to be positioned relative to the parent.
You need to apply z-index to children and control their stacking order.
You want to create a local positioning context for child elements.
Don’t use position: relative unnecessarily if:

You don’t have absolutely positioned children.
You don’t need a special positioning context or layering.
