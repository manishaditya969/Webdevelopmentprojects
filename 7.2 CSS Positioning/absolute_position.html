<!-- Summary of Absolute Positioning (position: absolute) in CSS
position: absolute removes an element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its closest positioned ancestor.

Key behaviors:

Once an element is set to position: absolute, it no longer affects the positioning of sibling elements, meaning other elements will behave as if it doesn’t exist (i.e., they can occupy the space it would have taken).
The element is positioned based on the nearest positioned ancestor:
A positioned ancestor is any ancestor element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed.
If no such ancestor exists, the element is positioned relative to the document body.
You can control the exact position using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. -->

<!-- Use Cases of position: absolute:
When you need precise control over an element’s placement.
To create components like modals, tooltips, or dropdown menus that need to "float" over other elements.
To layer elements by combining it with z-index. -->
