<!-- Summary of Relative Positioning (position: relative) in CSS
position: relative positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.

When an element is set to position: relative, it remains in the normal flow, but you can adjust its position using the top, right, bottom, or left properties.

Key behavior:

The space the element would have occupied in the normal flow is preserved, meaning other elements are not affected by its movement.
The element moves relative to its original position, but its original space is still "reserved." -->
