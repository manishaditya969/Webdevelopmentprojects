<!-- Summary of Static Positioning in CSS
position: static is the default positioning for all HTML elements.
When an element has position: static:
It is positioned according to the normal document flow (i.e., how elements naturally stack on the page without any special positioning).
Any values for top, right, bottom, or left are ignored because they only apply to elements with relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
The element does not create a new positioning context, meaning child elements cannot be positioned relative to it.

Key Points:
If you don't explicitly set the position property, it defaults to static.
Use position: static when you don't need to control the exact placement of an element, and you want it to follow the natural flow of the document.
If you need to move an element around using top, left, etc., use position: relative, absolute, or fixed instead. -->
